        "description": "Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization with close ties to former President Donald Trump, is at the center of an alleged tax-fraud scheme that spans more than a decade, according to an indictment unsealed last week in New York. Prosecutors say that the Trump Organization paid Weisselberg with lavish perks such as New York City apartments, luxury cars, private school tuition and other personal expenses, in addition to his base salary, and did not report that compensation to tax authorities, evading more than $900,000 in federal, state and local taxes. Attorneys for Weisselberg and the company pleaded not guilty in the case on Thursday, and said they plan to fight the charges."
